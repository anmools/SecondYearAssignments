Dear reader,

This folder includes the Web Development project I completed worth 70% of my continuous assessment.

The task I was given was to create a library system website.
The user should be able to sign up and create an account, or log into an already existing account. 
When registering, the process should validate all the details entered by the user e.g. a unique username is required.
The user should be able to search for books based on book title or author name. 
Alternatively, using a dropdown menu, the user will be able to find a book through different categories ie the book genre. 
The user will also be able to view all the books they have reserved already and remove any reservations through the same menu. 
Only one user may reserve a book at a time.


To complete this project the tools used were:
Backend: Apache(Web Server), PHP.
Frontend: HTML, CSS.
Databse: MySQL.
