Dear Reader,

In this folder is the Web Development 2 CA worth 70% of the CA grade I have completed.

The aim of the project was to make a webpage for a library system. Functions include: creating an account, logging in, browsing books, reserving books, view reserved books, unreserve a book and log out.

In this project I got a score of 59/70.
